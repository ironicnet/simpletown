### TODO:
- The workers should be move using double click instead of a single click.
- The woodcutter doesn't produce wood or logs
- The buildings need a "waypoint" where the workers could throw and pickup the resources.
- The builings should have a list of workers in it.
- The house and The woodcutter should have different colors than the background
- The units (house and buildings) should have a way to be selected and the user can see some info about it.
- The trees should check if there isn't a building before "spawning"
- The trees and buildings aren't blocking the path of the pathfinding
- When the workers carry a material, it should be shown in the unit.
- The buttons should be nicer :P
